Routines to edit video.

Compute center of interest (COI) for each frame based on the gazes of viewers.
Create new videos showing the gazes of the viewers with different formats.
Create new videos with magnification approaches based on democratic COI, static center of image, or random COI.
Apply bubble magnification, rectangle box, or ring cue around the COI.
